					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>In this lab we worked with JavaScript and jQuery with generating randomized text when a button is clicked. We had to make a conversation in divs to look similar to text. And like always, of course we had to make our html.index, css, js, and style our website from scratch.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section2">
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>In this lab I had a couple problems, I had a really hard time moving the text from left to right so it would look like a realistic conversation. After asking my TA and a super amazing awesome classmate I was able to figure it out. But my text was still not working properly and wasn't fully going to the right, I was able to figure out the issue and fix it. I also had some issues with the button that I was able to solve after asking Vibha.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section3">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>Once I was finished with the lab I was super proud of myself and the work I did. I keep looking back at my old labs and seeing how much I've learned an improved made me so happy. I was so excited to see my text and button work and I was able to add a scrollable section that I really liked.</p>
