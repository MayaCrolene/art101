					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we worked for the first time in JavaScript. We also used HTML and CSS and linked our style sheets.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into trouble linking the CSS Style Sheet to our index.html, so when we pushed our website and committed it to Origin originally it didn't work on the server but it was working locally. We realized we had missed the very important step of linking it went back and fixed our code and re-pushed it. Sometimes when I make changed in CSS it also doesn't work on my actual website so I ran into trouble there, that I was able to eventually fix and make to my liking. I also wish I could customize my text I made in JavaScript. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I enjoyed this assignment I feel like so much is possible when you understand JavaScript. I can tell my partners and me are getting more comfortable with coding and styling websites and it's so nice to be able to see our improvement. I look forward to using JavaScript in the future, I feel like I have a good general understanding of how it works so I'm excited to learn more. </p>
