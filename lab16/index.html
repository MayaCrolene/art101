					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>In this lab, our challenge was to create a JSON function to get an API from another website and then print it out on our page. This was similar to what we did last lab and what we did in class for the NASA API. So we were able to reuse some of our old code to aid us in this lab.</p>

					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>My partner and I both came across a few problems in this lab, our main one was with the "data" function that we had to rename "comicObj", but we forgot to replace it in a few places and had no idea why our code wasn't working till Vibha helped us. We realized that in class it was named "data" for clarity and was not a part of creating the function but a named function called "data". After we realized our mistake we fixed our mistake and got it to work. We also were stuck on finding the "APIKEY" and didn't realize for a bit that we didn't even need one and could just completely delete it from our js.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section3">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>After a bit of help from our TA Vibha, we were able to find our mistakes and fix them. Most of the mistakes we had were super simple, like words that should've been replaced with new words and missing characters. I think we did a good job on this lab despite it being nearly finals week we were able to finish it up flawlessly and submit it on time. </p>
