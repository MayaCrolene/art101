					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab the goal was to create anonymous functions and call them back in JavaScript. Our code would show up in the console in our website when opened. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was having a hard time making a "lab 8" folder with all the right elements and sub-folders. Which is so weird since last time with making "lab 7" it worked without complications. It was making my sub-folders merge with my lab 8 folder so it would look like: "lab 8/css". But I was able to figure this out after I rearranged the order of making the index.html, lab.css and my lab.js. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think I did a good job. Labs are getting slightly easier, and quicker to complete every time which makes me more confident in my abilities. It was exciting to be able to see my proper code in the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end I learned a bit about how anon functions and callbacks work. I feel like conceptually I understand, but in practice I am stuggling more with how to actually construct and address its back properly. CSS and HTML came much easier to me, I'm still fully completing the labs without errors though which tells me I'm on the right path. </p>
