					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we worked on defining functions and creating more in JavaScript. More specifically we practiced using pop-up boxes and ".split", ".sort" and more. We were also expected to create completely new folders and documents for Lab 7 and all future labs from now on.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a couple problems that I ran into in this lab, but overall I feel like this one was abit easier than  the last. Maybe I'm just getting better and learning more but I feel like In the end I was sucessfully able to accomplish all the tasks. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>In the end I am happy with our final websites, it's exciting we are using JavaScript more. I'm definitely struggling more with JavaScript than in CSS and HTML but I like the new opportunities JavaScript supplies. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Once finished with the lab I feel like I have a better understanding of JavaScript and how to properly use Functions.</p>
