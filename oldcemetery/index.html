					<h3> Address: Capitola Road Extension, Santa Cruz, CA 95062. Founding date: 1873.  </h3>
					<p>Often Native Americans who died at the Mission were wheelbarrowed to the Old Holy Cross Cemetery to be buried away from the Church. Of the 2,436 bodies at the cemetery half were children, and 2,000 were Native American. Natives were treated poorly by the Mission and even in the afterlife were not respected, they didn't believe indigenous people had souls and used this to justify burring them away from the Mission grounds. Most of the corpses don't have a name or reason attached, if there was a record of an identity it was of their given name by the colonizers and not their native name. </p>
