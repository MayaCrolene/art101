					<h3> Address: 120 Emmett St, Santa Cruz, CA 95060. Founding date: August 28, 1791. Nickname(s): "The Hard-luck Mission". </h3>
					<p>The stories we hear as children about the California Missions are so manipulated and warped it's one step away from being a fairytale. The reality of the indigenous people at the Santa Cruz Mission was one of pain, suffering, abuse, rape, murder, and slavery.</p>
					<p>2,289 Natives lived and labored at the mission, they were kept at the mission against their will. Often families were crowded into a single room with poor ventilation. Native Americans who didn't yet have families were shoved into rooms with other natives of the same gender. These rooms would lock from the outside to prevent men and women from interacting. They were abused and punished for speaking their native language, Padres were not above harming natives and would also torture and abuse them. During all hours of the day, Native Americans were expected to complete chores and tasks the mission bell ringing at every hour was a signal to keep them on a tight schedule. Life at the Mission was excruciating, men were murdered and abused, and women were raped and assaulted. Many of these diseases that killed off large portions of the indigenous population were due to sexual diseases that were forcefully inflicted on native women. Living at the Santa Cruz Mission was so horrid that women would commit acts of infanticide to avoid giving their children a brutal life. </p>
