					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>In this lab we had to code in JavaScript to make events & forms. The challange was to make a text box, and a button then have it return a sorted string back into the same div. Similar to lab 7, but completed by using a input instead of a pop-up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section2">
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>In this lab I had a couple problems, I kept misplacing the code in js so it wasn't in the function properly. I also had an issue when I pressed my button the text I wrote would just come back to me as "undefined" instead of a sorted version of the text submitted. I was able to fix all the problems I came across by asking my TA for help and asking my partner and other classmates.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section3">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>In the end I am happy with this lab and how it turned out I was able to complete it with no errors and edit my css to make it look visually nice. I think me and my partner both did a good job on figuring out how to do the lab and overcome all the problems we had.</p>
