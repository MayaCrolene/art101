					<h2>KU KLUX KLAN IN SANTA CRUZ</h2>

					<h3> Address: Exact Klavern location in Santa Cruz is unknown. Photo Taken: On Pacific Ave July 4, 1927. Founding date: Early 1920's. </h3>
					<p>Did you know we had the KKK in our town? Many people are oblivious to the fact we had the KKK in Santa Cruz, and it's no surprise that the history of this is so complicated to research and find evidence on. The photo above is the only known photo that proves the Ku Klux Klans' presence in Santa Cruz. There have been multiple instances of news articles about the Klan burning crosses, doing rituals, and having marches and parades in Santa Cruz County. There were at least 3 Klaverns established in Santa Cruz and Live Oak. The history of the KKK in our town is poorly recorded, rarely discussed, and not often taught to the community.</p>
					<p>Although the KKK has been disbanded in Santa Cruz for a few decades now prejudice against people of color is still prevalent. Stories to this day get published about scandals revolving around the KKK and racism in Santa Cruz. </p>
