					<h3> Address: Current Location: 149 River St S, Santa Cruz, CA 95060. Previous Locations: Pacific Ave circa 1862-1870, Front St circa 1870-1894, Blackburn circa 1894-1905, and Birkenseers circa 1894-1955.</h3>
					<p>There have been 4 Chinatowns in Santa Cruz. Most of them were demolished due to natural disasters and poor environmental conditions. The reason their homes kept getting destroyed was that they weren't allowed to own land, were not granted citizenship, worked for extremely low wages, and were confined to the borders of Chinatown. The rent in these areas was significantly lower due to it being subject to flooding, fire, and other natural disasters. Chinese immigrants were forced to live in these conditions because it was all they could afford and allowed to be. </p>
					<p>Currently, there is still one last Chinatown standing. Although now Chinatown just contains one statue in honor of the history of Chinese presence and resilience in Santa Cruz. This statue is incredibly important to Chinatown's history and reminds us to honor and remember the people who have been here before us and acknowledge their history and struggles. </p>
