					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>In this lab we had to work together to create a js loop function that will print out "Fizz!", "Buzz!", "Boom!", or some combination of the two ex: "FizzBuzz!". We had to make a function that goes up to #200, and have it print out our output in a new div. We should also be able to see the results in the console.</p>

					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>I had a few problems along the way in this lab. I had a super easy time doing Task 1, and the first half of Task 2. Because I was in class when we practiced this together, and had my previous code and just added onto it a bit. But once I reached The actuall function that puts the output into the "output" div, I was having a difficult time calling and defining the function properly. And when I wouold try and test out my website it would show up in my console, but not in my div. I talked with my partner and we were both striggling with this, so I looked in W3Shools, and my notes too see what I had. Finish this sentance once done!!!!</p>

					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>Once my code was all finished up, I was super proud of myself and the work I have done. Considering how difficult this weekend and our timeline was due to the break. I feel like I did a good job on this lab and went so far out of my way to figure out how to properly understand how to fix my code, and get my div to display the text right. </p>
