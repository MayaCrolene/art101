					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>In this lab we had to practice using jQuery and coding in JavaScript with event-listeners. We had to use functions to make a string of text appear in the console when the button is pressed as well as a .css change in the div. </p>

					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>I came accross many problems in this lab, and I would say out of all the labs we've done I had the most issues with this one. It was difficult for me to figure out why my code died and what was missing from my function to make it work properly. And because we only had two days of class last week it was difficult for me to learn and immediately put into practice something so fast. Luckily I was able to complete the lab, after I discussed with my partner and peers I was able to make the functions properly work when the button is clicked.</p>

			<div class="section3">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>Once I fixed my code everything started working properly. I am still not confident with working with js and jQuery but I am starting to better understand how to make it do simple tasks. I'm happy with the amount of effort I put into fixing and making this lab and I feel like in the end I did a great job figuring everything out.</p>
