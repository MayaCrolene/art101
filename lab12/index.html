					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a conditional by using "if" and "else if" statements in our JavaScript. We had to make a input field for a name and when the button was clicked return back a Hogwarts House the person is sorted to. We had to make 4 different returns based on the left over "remainder" of the persons name. We had to use event listeners, and "mod = len % 4;" in our functions to make the site work properly.</p>

					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>Honestly... I tend to have quite a bit of issues on my labs, but surprizingly this one went by fast for me with little errors. I did have one with getting th etext to display, but realized it was a simple mistake in my js, fixed it, then my script was working perfectly.</p>

			<div class="section3">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>I am happy with the results of this lab. I was playing with it to see how it changes what house I would be sorted into if my name was slightly longer, shorter, or spelled different. It was just fun to play around with. I added some of my personal style into this lab with some fun emojis and css. In the end I think me an my partner did a good job on this lab and were able to complete everything right! </p>
