			<h2>Here's a cool random fact: </h2>
		</div>
			<div class="section1">
					<h2>Challenge:</h2>
					<p>In this lab, our challenge was to send information back to our website from other websites by using APIs and AJAX. We had to find an API online and connect the URL Endpoint to our JavaScript, we then had to code a click function to our button to display text fetched from our external source. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="section2">
					<h2>Problems:</h2>
					<p>I had one major problem in this lab, all my code appeared correct but it would only return "undefined" when my button was clicked. I realized I was missing a very important step after talking to my TA and later emailing her. I forgot to say "results[0].answer" since the API I was using is inside an array. I remember going over this in class but using "data[0].___" instead but I didn't realize I had to change this to "results" instead. After a few hours of trying to fix my code and look at all the details, we were able to figure it out. I also linked my jQuery twice and that was also causing issues, but we were able to solve that issue pretty fast. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="section3">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>I had so much fun in this lab despite my problems. I think the possibilities of APIs and AJAX are super neat and I want to try and use it again larger scale. I think my partner and I put in a good effort and got perfect results in this lab.</p>
