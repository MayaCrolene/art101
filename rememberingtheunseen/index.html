					<h2>AULINTA (Santa Cruz Before Colonization)</h2>

					<p>Often the dark histories of cities are forgotten and covered up through time. However, the pain and historical trauma of the people who have suffered throughout generations is still present. To decolonize the places we are in we must learn the true stories and reteach history the right way. By being complicit with false myths you are actively engaging in the process of colonization, learning about narratives from the perspective of the oppressed aids all of us in reshaping our views and allows us to heal and help heal those around us. </p>
