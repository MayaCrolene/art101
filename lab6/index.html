			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this challange we worked in pairs to link JavaScript from our Console, and then link it again to our HTML/Website. We practiced using "Objects" and "Lists" we also used simple functions to figure out the age of our car. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>In this lab we came across a few problems, specifically with our console and the "myMainRide.age()", we were able to ask our TA for help and she was able to help us correct our code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I feel like we did an excellent job completing this lab properly and following all the tasks. I'm happy with my finished page, I feel like aesthetically and functionally it works well.</p>
