			<h4>Two or more player game</h4>

			<h4>The other player(s) try to guess the word/phrase</h4>
				<li>For every correct letter, Player 1 fills in the letter on top of the line they drew throughout the phrase, even if included multiple times</li>
				<li>For every incorrect letter, Player 1 writes the letter in the empty top section above the gallow, Player 1 also draws a body part of a stick figure starting with the head</li>
			<h4>The other player(s) take turns guessing the letters</h4>
			<h4>If one of the players is able to guess the word/phrase correctly then they win</h4>
				<li>If the player guesses incorrectly then you draw another body part onto the stick figure</li>
				<li>Players are able to guess wrong 7 times before they lose</li>
